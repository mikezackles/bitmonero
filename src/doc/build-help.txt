==== Hints for building ====


In case of building on linux with local boost,
especially tested on Debian 7 (64bit),
for older sources (e.g. 2014-06 .. 2014-08),
you have to apply modification to the sources to use local boost:

set(Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS TRUE)

right above this lines (number around 100) :

if(STATIC)
  set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
